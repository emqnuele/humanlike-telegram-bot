        "Oh no! Losing your keys is so frustrating. Let's try to figure out where they might be. To help me help you, let's go through a few common possibilities:\n\n*   **Retrace your steps:** Think back to the last time you definitely had your keys. Where were you? What were you doing? Try to mentally retrace your steps from that point onward.\n\n*   **Check common hiding spots:**\n\n    *   **Pockets:** Check all your pockets, even ones you don't normally use.\n    *   **Bags:** Thoroughly search all your bags, purses, backpacks, and briefcases.\n    *   **Under furniture:** Look under couches, chairs, and tables.\n    *   **In the car:** Check under the seats, in the glove compartment, and in the trunk.\n    *   **By the door:** Look on tables or shelves near the entrance you usually use.\n    *   **Where you last put them down:** Try to remember where you last set them down. Was it on a counter, a desk, or somewhere else?\n    *   **Laundry:** Have you done laundry recently? Check the washing machine and dryer.\n\n*   **Ask someone:** If you live with someone, ask them if they've seen your keys.\n\nLet me know if you've already checked some of these places, and we can brainstorm some other ideas! Good luck!\n"
